Hi, 

Run:
to run just cmd java  -jar [PATH]\geo-data-avg-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Output:
please not the the file output result will create the file in C:/User/YOUUSER by default. (can't be changed)

Dependecies:
1. The program uses the provided xplg-test with refactoring because that dep was made somehow different that modern java version can allow (default package)
2. Using mapbox for the geojson work
